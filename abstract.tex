\chapter*{Abstract}
\vspace{0.2in}
A large number of people gathered together and arranged in an unruly manner is known as a crowd. Monitoring the events taking place in the presence of crowd is of utmost importance. Today it is done manually by a human surveyor with the help of CCTV cameras. Our idea is to reduce the burden on the human surveyor by automating the process of detecting disturbance in the crowd. Critical amount of time may be saved by detecting disturbance in crowd instantaneously. This critical time we save may be the difference between life and death. This disturbance may be caused by any event such as bomb blast, fire, riots etc. This project focuses on implementation of an algorithm that can detect disturbance in the crowd. It considers flow-vector magnitudes change over time for a short set of frames to statistically determine whether those short set of frames are violent or non-violent. The challenge in this project is to keep the processing quick and real time, an alert should be generated within few seconds of change in crowd behaviour.
