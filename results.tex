\section{Video Preprocessing}
 Input frames are resized to 240 X 320. They are further converted to grayscale.

\end{figure}

\section{Optical Flow}
Optical flow refers to the visible motion of an object in an image, and the apparent 'flow' of pixels in an image. It is the result of 3d motion being projected on a 2-d image plane.

\section{Violent Features}
Violent Features for a video will contains 336 features. There are 21 bins in a histogram and each frame is divided into 16 blocks. Hence it results into a total of 21 * 16 = 336 features ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 .

\section{Neural Net N-folds Cross Verification}
Seven fold cross validation is the validation manner which is adopted in
experiments. All the videos are divided into seven heaps with the same ratio between
violent and non-violent ones. At each time one distinct heap is selected for testing and the other six heaps for training. This procedure is then repeated for seven times.

\section{Real Time Surveillance on Video Input}
There usually FPS rate of a standard surveillance is 25. Which means our algorithm has to process each frame in less than 1/25 th of a second. Real Time Surveillance of a Video outputs on terminal and it provides the exact second where the frames go from violent to non-violent. So with the help of this we are able to decide the exact second where the violence occurs.

\section{Real Time Surveillance on Camera Input}
OpenCV helps us to take video input directly from the camera connected. It can be externally connected through a usb port or it can be the internal webcam.

Violent Flows:Real-Time Detection of Violent Crowd Behaviour, 2012 [2] & Global descriptors and SVM classifier & 5-fold cross validation: 81.30 percent & The algorithm detected far more violent scenes correctly, compared to existing work. It was furthermore far faster to detect the violence, typically in less than a second from its outbreak & Only magnitude of the flow vectors is considered, but the direction is not.\\

Proposed Algorithm & Using Global Descriptors (ViFs) along with Neural Network to accurately predict disturbance in crowd. & 85.00 percent & Highly Scalable, can process multiple videos at a time using GPUs. Accuracy can be greatly imporved by increasing weights to well performing features. Input from human surveyor can continously train the model for better performance in future. & Only works for avi videos. Neural Net initial training takes time. \\
