\section{Conclusion}
A system which can identify disturbance in the crowd is performing successfully in real-time with high accuracy. Disturbance is the unruly behaviour of crowd caused due to panic or violence. The system is clearly able to differentiate between non-violent crowded scenes such as 'fans cheering in stadium' and violent crowded scenes such as 'prison gang fights'. The surveillance system generated can be used in real-time with CCTV cameras input and with video inputs also. The surveillance system has enough reaction time accuracy and classification accuracy to work independently. The generated system can perform surveillance on upto four input video streams at a time.

\section{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Scalability can be further improved using threads and multiprocessing.
	\item Code can be extended to HD videos also.
	\item Using AdaBoost feature selection algorithm top features among the 336 features have been extracted.
	\item We can use above selected features and increase the weights of the nodes that accept inputs from those particular features.
	\item By above step accuracy will be greatly increased.
	\item System can be connected with multiple cameras and the application can be tested.
	\item We can include the angle of motion change during calculation of ViF to improve accuracy.
\end{itemize}
