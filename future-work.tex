\chapter{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Scalability can be further improved using threads and multiprocessing.
	\item Code can be extended to HD videos also.
	\item Using AdaBoost feature selection algorithm top features among the 336 features have been extracted.
	\item We can use above selected features and increase the weights of the nodes that accept inputs from those particular features.
	\item By above step accuracy will be greatly increased.
	\item System can be connected with multiple cameras and the application can be tested.
	\item We can include the angle of motion change during calculation of ViF to improve accuracy.
