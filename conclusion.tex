\chapter{Conclusion}

A system which can identify disturbance in the crowd is performing successfully in real-time with high accuracy. Disturbance is the unruly behaviour of crowd caused due to panic or violence. The system is clearly able to differentiate between non-violent crowded scenes such as 'fans cheering in stadium' and violent crowded scenes such as 'prison gang fights'. The surveillance system generated can be used in real-time with CCTV cameras input and with video inputs also. The surveillance system has enough reaction time accuracy and classification accuracy to work independently. The generated system can perform surveillance on upto four input video streams at a time.
